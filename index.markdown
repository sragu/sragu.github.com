Hello, there. Nice to meet you!

I write software for [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com) and their clients.

You can follow my thoughts [here](https://twitter.com/sragu), and my code [here](https://github.com/sragu).

Here is the [feed](public/podcasts.opml) for the podcasts that I listen to generally.

Here is a curated [feed](https://lnns.co/48d-0luyVxp) of the episodes, I enjoyed recently.
