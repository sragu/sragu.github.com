    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are learn languages as progress through our programming career, we hate some; love some. Once a hot language of the day easily becomes enterprise for the next generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be a several reasons for that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming a thing that you very much mocked at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People learn and expect the language to grow with them, but not all languages grows - most stay right there where majority of users want them them to be at - even its harmful. or in other words they stay at the level of users who generate money for the language creator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new people have new perspectives, and they see things different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some languages stay stale with their initial propaganda, but things change, new problems arise (multi-core). (i.e. there is always a problem, but not the same problem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As much true that is the new language is never a new idea, it is just the same idea that has been around but executed better with the collective learning from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
